HR Analytics Dashboard – Employee Attrition Analysis
About the Project

I created an HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to study and understand employee attrition in a company. The main goal of this project is to help the HR team and management easily see how many employees are leaving, why they are leaving, and which groups are most affected.

This dashboard gives a clear picture of the company’s employee turnover and helps in making better decisions to improve employee retention.

What This Dashboard Shows

Overall Attrition Rate: Total number of employees who left the company.

Attrition Percentage: Percentage of employees who left compared to the total number of employees.

Yearly Attrition: How attrition has changed year by year.

Ranking-wise Attrition: Which departments or job positions have the highest attrition.

Salary-based Attrition: Whether employees with certain salary ranges are leaving more often.

Education-wise Attrition: Attrition comparison based on employees’ education levels.

Age Group-wise Attrition: Which age groups are leaving the company more frequently.

Tools and Techniques Used

Power BI Desktop for dashboard creation and data visualization.

Excel or CSV files as the main data source.

DAX formulas to calculate attrition rate, percentage, and rankings.

Different types of charts and slicers to make the dashboard interactive and easy to understand.

Shows whether age, education, or salary levels are related to employees leaving.

Gives data-driven insights to plan new HR strategies and reduce attrition.
